# Word Jumble

A word jumble game. The premise of the game is to transform one word into 
another by replacing a single letter in the starting word to form a new word 
and repeating until you match the last word.

So, letâ€™s say we have the word baked, which we want to transform into the word 
water. We do this by changing one letter in the word baked and forming a new 
word, repeating the single-letter replacement until we have the word water.

  * baked <- start
  * bated
  * batea
  * bater
  * water <- end

## The rules are:

  * You are only given a starting word and ending word
  * Change only one letter to form a new word
  * The new word must be a real word (in some dictionary)
  * The same word cannot appear twice
  * Each word must be the same length
